# Assessments
A repo dedicated to learning from the application assessments I have encountered in the wild (and probably failed).

The assessments criteria will be recreations from memory and as such, some of the details could be incomplete or flat incorrect.

The posted files will be working solutions that I developed after the fact.

Most of the files will be from applicant assessments but I may also post solutions from other coding challenges.
